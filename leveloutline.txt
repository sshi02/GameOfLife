Instance Variables:
levelID  <- lynchpin for naming system and identificaiton
cellLim  <- limits cells users can place
cellMin  <- minimum cells users are req to place
genLim   <- limits gens model can run through
genMin   <- minimum gens model is required to run through
winCells <- cells that will trigger a win
winMin   <- minimum number of alive cells that trigger a win
winCount <- EXACT number of alive cells that trigger a win
objecMes <- objective message for user
hint     <- message for user if they suck

Special values that need to be caught
if either null or -1, special indication attached

Construction of level:
Given a levelID (int likely), level call a super constructor
refering to a layout file (ex. level[levelId].csv). 
Then, a method will use levelID to intialize the rest of the 
instance variables. 
Method shoudl take in levelID, search for a 
levelData[levelID].csv file and read it. Formatting 
specified below.
Finally, the constructor checks for a progress file. If the 
file does not exist, nothing happens. Else, it will load the
user's progress. 

levelData[levelID].csv structure:
objecMes, hint,
cellLim, cellMin,
genLim, genMin,
winCount, winMin,
r1, c1, r2, c2... <- winCells

Checking for a win:
IMPORTANT INVARIANTS FOR A WIN CONDITION:
- cellLim MUST NOT be exceeded
- cellMin MUST be met or exceeded
- genLim MUST NOT be exceeded. If a genLim is exceeded, we 
  should expect the fail condition to be met.
- genMin MUST be met or exceeded
- winCells COULD be matching with some of the cells present 
  within the running model.
- winCount COULD be matched exactly and trigger a win IF AND
  ONLY IF genMin is met.
- winMin COULD be matched or exceeded.
When writing a win condition checker, the MUSTs have to be
checked first before considering the possibility of a win
For winCount and winMin, the IF AND ONLY IF conditions only
matter when genMin is defined.

Checking for a failure:
IMPORTANT INVARIANTS FOR A FAIL CONDITION:
- genLim COULD be exceeded.
- model find that an alive cell tries to generate in a kill
  cell. To find this, the failure condition should
  catch the return value of runGeneration().
